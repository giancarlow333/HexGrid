## [0.0.1] - 2023-08-21

* Add HexDraw.js file, copied from [redblobgames.com](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/implementation.js?2023-04-18-20-36-24).  Changes were made to support its use with my existing functions.  In particular:
    * I deleted all invocations of drawGrid, i.e. from line 232 on down.
    * I imported my Hex classes from HexGrid.js
    * I labeled each function as exportable.
